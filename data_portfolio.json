    "working": "I have been working in an architecture practice. During this time, I have developed different skills ranging from Design to Presentation (such are rendering, creating animations and video editing) all the way up to Programming (using tools and languages such as NodeJS, Docker, REST APIs, Revit API, C# etc) to become an invaluable member of the team. I have learned software development and hardware as well as I have even built my own render farm. I have done all of this as I believe without mastering the tools you use you cannot master the field in which you work. ",
